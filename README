Custom scenery for the caribbean islands Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Barbados and Antigua compiled by the terragear toolchain for flightgear based on data in https://github.com/D-ECHO/GDAB_data.
The Objects folder contains objects from terrasync and TAPA custom scenery by Lukas (object placement partly adjusted).

Have fun!

Installable as custom scenery, once completed and permission for objects given this will be pushed to terrasync (TS). [only valid for Terrain:] Any other incorporation in scenery packages or repository collections (including e.g. terraGIT) is not endorsed nor wanted by the creator of this custom scenery (D-ECHO).
